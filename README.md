# Hello, This is a project involving SQL basics
----

## Usage

> Individual project:

1.  Using Postresql and using pgAdmin along with SQL scripts.

I also used the [Pagila](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Sample_Databases) popular database example for PostreSQL. 

**Pagila: Based on MySQL's replacement for World, Sakila, which is itself inspired by the Dell DVD Store.**

## Thanks
