# SQL_Basics

# Hello, This is a project involving SQL basics
----

## Usage

> Individual project:

    Using PostreSQL and using pgAdmin after the Udemy class of Jose Portilla: The Complete SQL Camp!
    
    Here you wilL find my version of the assignments according to the class.  

I also used the [Pagila](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Sample_Databases) popular database example for PostreSQL. 

**Pagila: Based on MySQL's replacement for World, Sakila, which is itself inspired by the Dell DVD Store.**


    After installing both PostreSQL and pgAdmin the Database was created.
