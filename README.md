# Hello, This is a project involving SQL basics
----

## Usage

> Individual project:

    Using PostreSQL and using pgAdmin.

I also used the [Pagila](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Sample_Databases) popular database example for PostreSQL. 

**Pagila: Based on MySQL's replacement for World, Sakila, which is itself inspired by the Dell DVD Store.**


    After installing both PostreSQL and pgAdmin the Database was created.



# Some of the most common basic operators used in SQL

----

OPERATOR                        |  DESCRIPTION               
----

          ==         | Equal 
          
          >          | Greater than 
          
          <          | Less than 

          >=         | Greater than or equal 

          <=         | Less than or equal 

       <> or !=      | Not equal 

         AND         | Logical operator AND

             OR      | Logical operator OR


       
### SELECT Statement


SELECT statement..

Note:  The SQL key words should always be in uppercase.

From the dvd store we will use some select statements and other basic query syntax.

Let's see what's on the store table.


    SELECT * from actor;   

    -- This is a comment and " ; " signifies the end of a statement 

    -- " * " means that is grabbing all of it on the table.
