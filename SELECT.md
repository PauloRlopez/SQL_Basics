# SELECT Statement


Using the SELECT statement

Important Note:  The SQL key words should always be in uppercase. This is for ease of readability.

From the dvd store we will use some select statements and other basic query syntax.

For Example:

Let's see what's on the film table.

    -- This is a comment and the semicolon " ; " signifies is the end of a statement.

    -- The asterik symbol " * " means that is grabbing all of it on the table.
    
    SELECT * from film;
