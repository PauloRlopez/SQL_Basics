# LIMIT_FUNCTION
----
## How to use it?


> The LIMIT function retrieves the number of items in a group or more tables but it limits the number of records returned based on the limit mentioned in a query.  It is very useful when wanting to get all columns but not all rows.

----
## usage and examples

From the previous database we can grab all the number of items in the country table but let's only check for the first 12 countries.


     SELECT * FROM country
     LIMIT 5;
