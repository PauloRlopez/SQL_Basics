# WHERE STATEMENT


The WHERE statement is used in conjunction with the SELECT statement and some LOGICAL OPERATORS.
It's mostly used when you want to grab an specific value.

For instance, in our DVD database there are a lot of prices for the DVD rental of a movie.  Let's say we want to find an specifics price for movie rentals.

What are the payments for a rental amount (greater than 11) dollars?

    SELECT * FROM payment
    WHERE amount  > 11;

Other example:

Same as above but we are going to look for amounts not equal to 13.99, like this:

    SELECT amount, payment_date 
    FROM payment 
    WHERE amount <> 13.99;
