# COUNT_FUNCTION
----
## How to use it?


> The COUNT (*) function returns the number of items in a group, including NULL values and duplicates that matches a specific condition of a query. We can also use COUNT (ALL) which will return the number of non-null values.  Also, the COUNT (DISTINCT) will return in a group or row the number of unique non-null values.

----
## usage and examples

From the previous database we can grab all the number of items in the payment table like this.


     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payment;
     
![Alt text](https://github.com/PauloRlopez/SQL_Basics/blob/master/Images/count1.png?raw="count1")

Now we can use it with DISTINCT as well;

     SELECT(DISTINCT amount) 
     FROM payment;
